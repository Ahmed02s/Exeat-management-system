            <h2>Data Protection Measures</h2>
            <div class="measure">
                <h3>Encryption</h3>
                <p>We use advanced encryption technologies to protect your data both in transit and at rest. This means that any information you share with us is encrypted and cannot be easily accessed by unauthorized parties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="measure">
                <h3>Access Control</h3>
                <p>Our systems are designed with strict access controls. Only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data, and we use multi-factor authentication to ensure that access is granted only to those who need it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="measure">
                <h3>Regular Security Audits</h3>
                <p>We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses in our system. These audits help us stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain a high level of security.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="measure">
                <h3>Secure Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>Our infrastructure is hosted on secure servers with built-in protection against attacks. We use firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures to protect our systems from unauthorized access.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="measure">
                <h3>Data Backup</h3>
                <p>We perform regular backups of all critical data to ensure that it can be recovered in the event of a data loss or system failure. Our backup systems are also encrypted and stored securely.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
            <div class="responsibility">
                <h3>Password Management</h3>
                <p>It is important to use strong, unique passwords for your accounts. We recommend that you change your password regularly and avoid sharing it with others. If you suspect that your password has been compromised, please change it immediately.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="responsibility">
                <h3>Account Security</h3>
                <p>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available. This adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password.</p>
            </div>
